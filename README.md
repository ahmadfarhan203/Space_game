To develop this game i used some function which are given below:

window.addEventListener = allows you to add event listeners on any HTML DOM object such as HTML elements, the HTML document, the window object, or other objects that support events, like the xmlHttpRequest object.

appendChild=method is used to insert a new node or reposition an existing node as the last child of a particular parent node.

setTimeout= method sets a timer which executes a function or specified piece of code once the timer expires.

parseInt=function parses a string argument and returns an integer of the specified radix (the base in mathematical numeral systems).
